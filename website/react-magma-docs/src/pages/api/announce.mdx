<LeadParagraph>
When dynamically changing content on a page, it is important that all users become aware of these changes. While changes may be visually apparent to users who cans see the page,
they may not be clear to users of assistive technology. The `Announce` component uses the `aria-live` attribute to to expose dynamic content to those using screen readers.
</LeadParagraph>

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Announce, Button } from 'react-magma-dom';

export function Example() {
  const [announceContent, setAnnounceContent] = React.useState<string>(
    'Initial content'
  );

  function updateAnnounceContent() {
    setAnnounceContent('New content replacing the initial content');
  }

  return (
    <>
      <p>This content will be read by a screen reader when it changes.</p>
      <p>
        <Button onClick={updateAnnounceContent}>Update content</Button>
      </p>
      <Announce>
        <p>{announceContent}</p>
      </Announce>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Politeness

The `Announce` component takes an optional `politeness` prop, that accepts the following values: `assertive`, `off`, and `polite`. The default value is `polite`.
This sets the value of the `aria-live` attribute and is used to set the priority with which screen reader should treat updates to live regions.

When `polite` is used, assistive technology will notify a users of a change after the current task is complete. When `assertive` is used, assistive technologies will notify the user immediately,
possibly interrupting the current task. Using `off` will silence these updates, so they will not be read.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Announce, Button } from 'react-magma-dom';

export function Example() {
  const [
    announceContentAssertive,
    setAnnounceContentAssertive,
  ] = React.useState<string>('Initial assertive content');
  const [announceContentOff, setAnnounceContentOff] = React.useState<string>(
    'Initial off content'
  );

  function updateAnnounceContentAssertive() {
    setAnnounceContentAssertive(
      'New content replacing the assertive initial content'
    );
  }

  function updateAnnounceContentOff() {
    setAnnounceContentOff('New content replacing the off initial content');
  }

  return (
    <>
      <p>
        This content will be read by a screen reader immediately when it
        changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <Button onClick={updateAnnounceContentAssertive}>
          Update assertive content
        </Button>
      </p>
      <Announce politeness="assertive">
        <p>{announceContentAssertive}</p>
      </Announce>
      <hr />
      <p>This content will be not read by a screen reader when it changes.</p>
      <p>
        <Button onClick={updateAnnounceContentOff}>Update off content</Button>
      </p>
      <Announce politeness="off">
        <p>{announceContentOff}</p>
      </Announce>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Announce Props

**This component uses `forwardRef`. The ref is applied to the Announce container `div` element.**

All of the [global HTML attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes) can be provided as props and will be applied to the wrapping `div` element that gets rendered.

<AnnounceProps />
