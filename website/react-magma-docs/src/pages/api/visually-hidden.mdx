  Using the VisuallyHidden component will hide the children of this component
  visually, while still allowing the content to be accessed by screenreaders.
</LeadParagraph>

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { VisuallyHidden } from 'react-magma-dom';

export function Example() {
  return (
    <VisuallyHidden>
      This text can be read by a screen reader, but does not appear on the
      screen.
    </VisuallyHidden>
  );
}
```

## Visually Hidden Props

**This component uses `forwardRef`. The ref is applied to the outer `div` element.**

All of the [global HTML attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes) can be provided as props and will be applied to the wrapping `div` element that gets rendered.

<VisuallyHiddenProps />

</PageContent>
