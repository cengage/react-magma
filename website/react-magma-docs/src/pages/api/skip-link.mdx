<PageContent componentName="skip_link" type="api">

<LeadParagraph>
  Because the main content is often not the first thing on a page, it is
  valuable to provide a Skip Navigation link to allow users who navigate via
  keyboard and/or screen reader to jump directly to the content. The SkipLink
  component is the button that will jump the user to the main content area.

<Alert variant="info">
  Due to the nature of SkipLinks the best way to view the examples is to click
  "EDIT IN CODESANDBOX". When codesandbox loads click "open in new window" and
  hit tab to give focus to the SkipLink.
</Alert>

## Basic Usage

SkipLink should be the first item in your app, positioned in the DOM before the navigation and the content. Users will not see the component unless they are navigating by keyboard.

The `SkipLinkContent` component is the div that is the target of the `SkipLink`. It can either be used as a wrapper for your content, or as a sibling of your content.
If there is an h1 heading inside the SkipLinkContent, the h1 will receive focus. Otherwise, just the SkipLinkContent div itself will get focus.

Because the `SkipLink` and `SkipLinkContent` work based on an `id`, it is important that you only have one pair of these elements on a page.

```tsx noRender
import React from 'react';

import {
  SkipLink,
  SkipLinkContent,
  Paragraph,
  Hyperlink,
} from 'react-magma-dom';

const SideNav = ({ length }) => {
  return (
    <nav>
      {[...Array(length).keys()].map(index => (
        <div key={index}>
          <Hyperlink to={`#${index}`}>Link ${index}</Hyperlink>
        </div>
      ))}
    </nav>
  );
};

export function Example() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SkipLink buttonText="Skip to main content" />
      <SideNav length={500} />
      <SkipLinkContent>
        <Paragraph>Content to jump to.</Paragraph>
      </SkipLinkContent>
      <Paragraph>Additional content.</Paragraph>
    </div>
  );
}
```

When the user tabs to the first element, a hyperlink with this appearance will display in focus:

## Button Variations

By default, the `SkipLink` looks like a standard button with `color` as`primary`, `variant` as `solid`, and `isInverse` as false.

Variants for buttons include `solid`, `outline`, and `link`.
Colors for buttons include `primary`, `secondary`, `success`, and `danger`.
IsInverse is can be either `true` or `false`, and is used when the SkipLink is to appear on a dark background.

For more information, see the <Link to="/api/button">Button Component documentation</Link>.

```tsx noRender
import React from 'react';

import {
  SkipLink,
  SkipLinkContent,
  Paragraph,
  Hyperlink,
  ButtonVariant,
} from 'react-magma-dom';

const SideNav = ({ length }) => {
  return (
    <nav>
      {[...Array(length).keys()].map(index => (
        <div key={index}>
          <Hyperlink to={`#${index}`}>Link ${index}</Hyperlink>
        </div>
      ))}
    </nav>
  );
};

export function Example() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SkipLink
        buttonText="Skip to main content"
        variant={ButtonVariant.solid}
      />
      <SideNav length={500} />
      <SkipLinkContent>
        <Paragraph>Content to jump to.</Paragraph>
      </SkipLinkContent>
      <Paragraph>Additional content.</Paragraph>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Button Text

By default, the text inside the button says "Skip Navigation". This can be overridden using the `buttonText` prop.

```tsx noRender
import React from 'react';

import {
  SkipLink,
  SkipLinkContent,
  Paragraph,
  Hyperlink,
} from 'react-magma-dom';

const SideNav = ({ length }) => {
  return (
    <nav>
      {[...Array(length).keys()].map(index => (
        <div key={index}>
          <Hyperlink to={`#${index}`}>Link ${index}</Hyperlink>
        </div>
      ))}
    </nav>
  );
};

export function Example() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SkipLink buttonText="Skip to main content" />
      <SideNav length={500} />
      <SkipLinkContent>
        <Paragraph>Content to jump to.</Paragraph>
      </SkipLinkContent>
      <Paragraph>Additional content.</Paragraph>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Positioning

By default, the `SkipLink` is fixed positioned 10px from the top and 10px from left of the screen. This can be customized using the optional `positionLeft`
and `positionTop` properties, which take numeric values.

```tsx noRender
import React from 'react';

import {
  SkipLink,
  SkipLinkContent,
  Paragraph,
  Hyperlink,
} from 'react-magma-dom';

const SideNav = ({ length }) => {
  return (
    <nav>
      {[...Array(length).keys()].map(index => (
        <div key={index}>
          <Hyperlink to={`#${index}`}>Link ${index}</Hyperlink>
        </div>
      ))}
    </nav>
  );
};

export function Example() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SkipLink
        buttonText="Skip to main content"
        positionLeft={25}
        positionTop={25}
      />
      <SideNav length={500} />
      <SkipLinkContent>
        <Paragraph>Content to jump to.</Paragraph>
      </SkipLinkContent>
      <Paragraph>Additional content.</Paragraph>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## With AppBar

The `SkipLink` works concurrently with `AppBar` which assists in keyboard navigation.

```tsx
import React from 'react';

import {
  AppBar,
  AppBarPosition,
  SkipLink,
  SkipLinkContent,
  Paragraph,
} from 'react-magma-dom';

export function Example() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: '400px', overflow: 'auto', position: 'relative' }}>
      <AppBar position={AppBarPosition.sticky}>AppBar content</AppBar>
      <SkipLink buttonText="Skip to main content" to="#last-one" />

      <Paragraph>
        Peel the onion peel the onion, so the horse is out of the barn per my
        previous email, nor draw a line in the sand. I just wanted to give you a
        heads-up drink from the firehose, game plan back-end of third quarter
        viral engagement. Eat our own dog food driving the initiative forward
        tribal knowledge increase the pipelines, but run it up the flag pole.
      </Paragraph>
      <SkipLinkContent>
        <Paragraph id="last-one">
          Turn the crank regroup can we align on lunch orders, so regroup, yet
          the last person we talked to said this would be ready, for this vendor
          is incompetent , or pipeline. We've bootstrapped the model zeitgeist,
          so let's schedule a standup during the sprint to review our kpis, so
          not the long pole in my tent we're ahead of the curve on that one, and
          we're ahead of the curve on that one.{' '}
        </Paragraph>
      </SkipLinkContent>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This would render the button 25px from the top, and 25px from the left of the browser window.

## Skip Link Props
