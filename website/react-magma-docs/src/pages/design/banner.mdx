  Banners are typically used for system or application level alerts. They fill
  the full width of their container and are intended to be used without margins.

## Usage

Banner alerts appear at the very top of the browser viewport and extend all the way across. Banner alerts can be an effective way of telling the user about something that impacts the entire application such as a planned maintenance notification or an important world event that impacts all users. Banner alerts are by their nature the most disruptive type of alert so you may decide whether you want the alert to persist or allow the user to dismiss the alert themselves.
