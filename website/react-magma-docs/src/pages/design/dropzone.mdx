  Dropzones allow users to upload their own content. They are commonly used
  within forms but may also exist on their own.

1. **File type icon:** Helps quickly identify the type of file that was uploaded.
1. **File name:** Helps the user confirm they uploaded the correct file.
1. **Delete button:** Allows the user to delete the uploaded file.

### Loading States

A file being uploaded has three different states – loading, success, and uploaded.

### File Types

We use icons on the uploaded file planks to help quickly identify certain commonly used file types – PDF, MS Word, MS Excel, MS Powerpoint, zipped files, etc. For file types we don’t have a specific icon for, we use a general file icon.

### Overflow

If the name of the file is too long for the space allowed within the container, it will be truncated with an ellipsis (...)

## Validation

When there’s an error uploading a specific file, that file will show an error state with a message. The component comes with basic validation messaging already built into it so you don't have to configure that every time. But if a custom validation message is necessary, make sure the message describes how the user can fix the issue. If the file upload is part of a larger form, you may also include an inline alert at the top of the form.

If the error is with the uploader itself and not a specific file, then a validation error message will display below the drop zone or upload button.
