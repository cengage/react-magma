## Select vs. Dropdown

While the Select and Dropdown components can look similar, they have different functions.

- Use the Select component inside a form where users are selecting from a list of options and submitting data.
- Use the Dropdown component to display menus and filter or sort content on a page.

## Advanced Selects

### Multiselect

Multiselects are exactly what the name implies â€“ A Select input that allows the user to choose multiple values to be submitted at the same time. Previously selected options may be removed with the associated close/remove button.

### Combobox

A Combobox is similar to a Select component, in that it is used for collecting user provided information from a list of options. However, a combobox also allows users to type in the field, either to create their own option or to see typeahead suggestions. This can also be combined with the Multiselect functionality.
