## Select vs. Dropdown

While the Select and Dropdown components can look similar, they have different functions.

- Use the Select component inside a form where users are selecting from a list of options and submitting data.
- Use the Dropdown component to display a list of menu options.

## Multiselect

Multiselects are exactly what the name implies â€“ A Select input that allows the user to choose multiple values to be submitted at the same time. Previously selected options may be removed with the associated close/remove button.
