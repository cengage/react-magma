<LeadParagraph>Toggle Switches allow the user to select options.</LeadParagraph>

## Usage

Use toggle switches to toggle the state of a single setting on or off. You may use toggle switches within a web application, but keep in mind that they are most common within mobile applications.

<figure>
  <div class="image-container">
    <img
      src="../../images/selection-controls/Toggle-switch-example.png"
      alt=""
    />
  </div>
  <figcaption>
    <p>Toggle switches</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## States

The state of a toggle switch is changed by tapping or clicking on it, and the handle slides over to the other side of the track.

## Text Label

The setting that the switch controls is made clear by the inline text label.

  <div class="image-container">
    <img
      src="../../images/selection-controls/Toggle-switch-states.png"
      alt=""
    />
  </div>
  <figcaption>
    <p>Toggle switch states</p>
