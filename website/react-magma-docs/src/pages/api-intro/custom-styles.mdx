# Custom Styles for React Magma Components

The React Magma component library has been intentionally designed for use across multiple platforms.
It is recommended to use the default styles that come with any component whenever possible.
However, there may be occasions where overriding the default styles is required, and this can be accomplished in a number of ways.

## Style Prop

Custom styles can be passed to components using the `style` prop.

Magma variables can also be used in the style prop to apply themed styles on the fly.

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { Button, Paragraph } from 'react-magma-dom';

export function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <Button style={{ borderRadius: '40px', minWidth: '300px' }}>
        Custom Button
      </Button>
      <Paragraph>
        A paragraph with some inline{' '}
        <span style={{ color: magma.colors.success, fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
          success
        </span>{' '}
        styles.
      </Paragraph>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Style Props for Complex Components

Some non-atomic components support styling of individual elements within the component via use of specific props.
For example, the <Link to="/api/checkboxes">Checkbox</Link> supports the following properties: `containerStyle`, `inputStyle`
and `labelStyle`. In these cases, the `style` prop would have no effect because there is more than one element to target.

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'react-magma-dom';

export function Example() {
  return (
    <Checkbox
      checked
      containerStyle={{ border: '1px dotted purple' }}
      inputStyle={{ boxShadow: '3px 3px 3px rgba(0, 0 , 0, .6)' }}
      labelStyle={{ color: 'brown', fontStyle: 'italic' }}
      labelText="Custom Styles"
    />
  );
}
```

## Extending Styles With Emotion

React Magma styles are built with the [Emotion library](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) using styled-components.  
If you are using Emotion in your app, you can extend the styles of React Magma components. This is useful if you want to add custom styles that do not fit into the `style` prop, such as styles for pseudo elements, pseudo classes, and media queries.

Note: If the styles in your app are injected before the React Magma styles, your styles might not get applied if the specificity is the same.
To ensure your styles are applied, you can use use the ampersand (&) character, as shown in this example.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'react-magma-dom';
import styled from '@emotion/styled';

const StyledButton = styled(Button)`
  && {
    background: purple;

    &&:hover,
    &&:focus {
      background: green;
    }
  }
`;

export function Example() {
  return <StyledButton>Demo button</StyledButton>;
}
```

## Creating Custom Themes

Custom themes can be created by extending the Magma theme with your own values.
The complete Magma theme can be found in the [Github repository](https://github.com/cengage/react-magma/blob/acc469c1499da986248c312009951a9d74ed8f16/packages/react-magma-dom/src/theme/magma.ts).

To apply the custom theme, use the <Link to="/api/theme/">ThemeContext.Provider</Link>, passing in your custom theme as the value property.
Any descendants of the context provider will receive the theme that is passed in.

```typescript
import { Heading, Paragraph, ThemeContext, magma } from 'react-magma-dom';

const theme = {
  ...magma,
  headingFont: 'Papyrus, sans-serif',

  colors: {
    ...magma.colors,
  },
};

export function Example() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
      <Heading level={1}>Custom Theme</Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        Custom themes are fun for all! But you must use them carefully... or
        they can change your life.
      </Paragraph>
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
```
