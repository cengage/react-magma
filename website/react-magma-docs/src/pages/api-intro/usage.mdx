<LeadParagraph>
How to use React Magma components. The examples here use the <Link to="/api/button">Button</Link> component. More information about each of the components can be found in the Component API section.
</LeadParagraph>

## Basic Usage

To use a component, simply import the component and add it to your UI. The styles are already bundled with the component.
Here is a most basic example:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'react-magma-dom';

function Example() {
  return <Button>Hello World</Button>;
}
```

## Using TypeScript Enums

When using a prop that takes an enum, you must import that type from React Magma if you are using TypeScript.

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { Button, ButtonVariant } from 'react-magma-dom';

function Example() {
  return <Button variant={ButtonVariant.solid}>Hello World</Button>;
}
```

## Importing Global Styles

Most of the styles for React Magma are bundled within their components. However, a `GlobalStyles` object is available, which provides a
very basic CSS reset plus the required fonts, body styles, and some generic styles for links. It is recommended that you use this `GlobalStyles` component in any app that uses React Magma
to insure consistency across products.

To use the `GlobalStyles` object, simply import it from `react-magma-dom` and include it in your App.

The `GlobalStyles` component can be nested inside the <Link to="/api/theme">ThemeContext.Provider</Link> to inherit styles from the theme.

```js noRender startExpanded
import React from 'react';
import { GlobalStyles } from 'react-magma-dom';

function Example() {
  return (
    <div>
      <GlobalStyles />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Using the Magma Theme

React Magma uses the Magma theme for styles, which includes fonts, colors and screen sizes for media queries. To remain consistent,
you can import `magma` and reference these values in your application's styles.

The complete Magma theme can be found in the [Github repository](https://github.com/cengage/react-magma/blob/acc469c1499da986248c312009951a9d74ed8f16/packages/react-magma-dom/src/theme/magma.ts).
For more information about colors, see the <Link to="../../design-intro/colors/">Design Documentation</Link>.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { magma } from 'react-magma-dom';
import styled from '@emotion/styled';

function Example() {
  const StyledDiv = styled.div`
    background: ${magma.colors.neutral};
    color: ${magma.colors.neutral100};
  `;

  return <StyledDiv>Hello world</StyledDiv>;
}
```

## Testing

We recommend using [jest](https://jestjs.io/) with [`@testing-library/react`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro).

Wherever possible selecting elements should be handled using visible text or aria-labels with the `@testing-library/react` queries for `text` and `labelText`. If there are multiple elements that are returned from a query you can refine the results using the [`SelectorMatcherOptions`](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library/blob/19901e13b6acd11df580ddf6dd35540a39c5eaaf/types/query-helpers.d.ts#L4) in your query.

If that is not sufficient, each of our components accept a `testId` that is passed to the primary element as a `data-testid` attribute that can be found with the `getByTestId` helper function from `@testing-library/react`.
