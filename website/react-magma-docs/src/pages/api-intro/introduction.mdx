</LeadParagraph>

For more information, including information on contributing to React Magma and running the project locally, visit the [Github Repo](https://github.com/cengage/react-magma).

## Installation

### Setup Requirements

1. Your project needs to be running **React v18**
2. Icons must be installed as a peer dependency

### Install the Component Library

Install the React Magma Component library with `npm`.

```sh-title-noRender-noCodeSandbox
npm install --save react-magma-dom
```

Install peer dependencies

```sh-title-noRender-noCodeSandbox
npm install --save \
    "@emotion/react@^11.14.0" \
    "@emotion/styled@^11.14.0" \
    "date-fns@2.30.0" \
    "downshift@5.4.5" \
    "framer-motion@^11.18.2" \
    "react@^18.3.1" \
    "react-dom@^18.3.1" \
    "react-magma-icons@3.2.0" \
    "uuid@8.3.4"
```

## Icons Only

The Icon library is not dependent on react-magma being used. `react-magma-icons` can be used independently by installing the package as a dependency in your project.

```sh-title-noRender-noCodeSandbox
npm install --save react-magma-icons
```

## Known Issues

1. `Legacy context API has been detected within a strict-mode tree` - https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/3487
