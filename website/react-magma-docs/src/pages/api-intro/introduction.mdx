  accessible components in your application.
</LeadParagraph>

For more information, including information on contributing to React Magma and running the project locally, visit the [Github Repo](https://github.com/cengage/react-magma).

## Installation

### Setup Requirements

1. Your project needs to be running **React v17** or greater
2. Icons must be installed as a peer dependency

### Install the Component Library

Install the React Magma Component library with `npm`.

```sh title noRender noCodeSandbox
npm install --save react-magma-dom
```

Install peer dependencies

```sh title noRender noCodeSandbox
npm install --save \
    "@emotion/core@10.1.1" \
    "@emotion/styled@10.0.27" \
    "date-fns@2.16.1" \
    "downshift@5.4.5" \
    "framer-motion@^4.1.11" \
    "react@17.0.2" \
    "react-dom@17.0.2" \
    "react-magma-icons@3.0.0" \
    "uuid@8.3.0"
```

## Icons Only

The Icon library is not dependent on react-magma being used. `react-magma-icons` can be used independently by installing the package as a dependency in your project.

```sh title noRender noCodeSandbox
npm install --save react-magma-icons
```

## Known Issues

1. `Legacy context API has been detected within a strict-mode tree` - https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/3487
